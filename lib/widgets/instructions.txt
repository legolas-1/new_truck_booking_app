1. why files named screens are in this folder ?? Decide where they fit better and then put them in 
screens or widgets.

widgets will contains like a small block of UI which will be repeated on many screens
,like a card, or button, textInputField etc.

screens will contains screens whole screens, which will be shown on change of route 
and whole screen will appear. and remember only one screen should be displayed at a time.

model will contains blueprint of data we are getting. and field we are going to use with truck
will be defined in a model class.


Keeping above points in mind, divide your code in screens and widgets.
